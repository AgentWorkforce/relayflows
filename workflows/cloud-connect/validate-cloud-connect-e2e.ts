 * validate-cloud-connect-e2e.ts
 *
 * ## Problem
 *
 * `agent-relay cloud connect <provider>` still appears to hang for users on
 * the released Bun binary (v4.0.26), even after:
 *   - PR #743 (handler-order + exec sh -c refactor in ssh-interactive.ts)
 *   - PR #744 (wrapWithLaunchCheckpoint — visible printf breadcrumb before
 *     the provider CLI enters alt-screen)
 *
 * The user upgrades, runs `cloud connect claude`, sees the unified
 * "Starting interactive authentication…" banner, and then… silence. No
 * `[agent-relay] launching provider CLI…` line. No claude TUI. Nothing.
 *
 * ## Root-cause hypothesis
 *
 * `scripts/build-bun.sh` passes `--external ssh2` to `bun build --compile`
 * on BOTH the cross-compile loop (line 68) and the current-platform build
 * (line 104). That means the released standalone binary does NOT contain
 * ssh2. At runtime, `loadSSH2()` attempts `import('ssh2')`, which throws
 * inside a packaged Bun binary, so the helper returns null and the CLI
 * falls through to the system-ssh fallback path in ssh-interactive.ts.
 *
 * The ssh2 path has rich observability (AGENT_RELAY_DEBUG_SSH, first-byte
 * timing, stream lifecycle, line-clearing hint). The system-ssh fallback
 * has ALMOST NONE: it shells out to `ssh -tt user@host 'remoteCommand'`
 * and inherits stdio. If the remote command hangs during environment
 * setup — before `printf '…launching provider CLI…'` ever runs — the user
 * sees no breadcrumb because the printf never executed.
 *
 * Every fix we've shipped so far has lived in the ssh2 branch or in the
 * remote command string that the ssh2 branch writes into the PTY. None of
 * those fixes reach released-binary users because they aren't running the
 * ssh2 branch at all.
 *
 * We validated locally that ssh2 bundles cleanly into a Bun compile:
 *
 *   bun build --compile --target=bun-darwin-arm64 \
 *     --external better-sqlite3 --external cpu-features --external node-pty \
 *     ./dist/src/cli/index.js --outfile /tmp/ssh2-bundle-test/agent-relay-ssh2
 *   # → 986 modules, 62M binary, --version works
 *
 * ## Fix
 *
 *   1. Drop `--external ssh2` from both occurrences in scripts/build-bun.sh.
 *   2. Add a real ssh2 integration test (tests/integration/ssh-interactive-live.test.ts)
 *      that spawns an in-process ssh2 Server, runs `runInteractiveSession`
 *      against it WITHOUT mocking the runtime, and asserts the launch
 *      checkpoint printf is visible in captured stdout. This is the
 *      mechanical E2E proof that the ssh2 path actually reaches the printf.
 *   3. Rebuild the Bun binary from scratch and validate:
 *      - Binary runs: `./.release/agent-relay --version` exits 0
 *      - Binary contains ssh2: `strings` output references ssh2 / ssh-userauth
 *      - Binary exercises the ssh2 branch at runtime (not fallback)
 *
 * ## Acceptance contract
 *
 *   A1  scripts/build-bun.sh contains zero `--external ssh2` occurrences
 *   A2  Existing unit tests green: ssh-interactive.test.ts (13 tests) +
 *       packages/cloud/src/auth.test.ts (10 tests)
 *   A3  `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean
 *   A4  tests/integration/ssh-interactive-live.test.ts exists and passes.
 *       It spins up an in-process ssh2 Server on a random port, calls
 *       runInteractiveSession with a default runtime (no loadSSH2 mock),
 *       and asserts:
 *         - the ssh2 client connects successfully
 *         - a shell session is opened on the fake server
 *         - the first payload received by the fake shell STARTS with
 *           `exec sh -c '` and contains `launching provider CLI`
 *         - captured stdout (via a write-spy) includes the dim-ANSI
 *           "launching provider CLI…" breadcrumb as proof the pipeline
 *           reached the printf
 *   A5  `npm run build && bash scripts/build-bun.sh` produces a binary at
 *       .release/agent-relay that runs `--version` successfully
 *   A6  The built binary contains ssh2 symbols (proof ssh2 is bundled).
 *       Heuristic check: `strings .release/agent-relay | grep -c 'ssh-userauth'`
 *       returns >= 1
 *   A7  `npm run orchestrator:test` (or the project's regression suite)
 *       still green
 *   A8  No commit is made until A1-A7 all pass
 *
 * ## What this workflow explicitly does NOT cover
 *
 *   - Live Daytona validation. Real Daytona sessions cost money per run and
 *     require CLOUD_API_* credentials. After this workflow is green, the
 *     operator must run `./.release/agent-relay cloud connect claude`
 *     against a real Daytona sandbox to confirm the fix works end-to-end.
 *     The workflow prints explicit validation instructions in its final
 *     summary step.
 *

      timeoutMs: 900_000,
      task: `Create \`${LIVE_TEST}\`. This is a NEW integration test — there is no existing one to extend.

The test must spin up an in-process ssh2 Server, call \`runInteractiveSession\` from \`src/cli/lib/ssh-interactive.ts\` with the DEFAULT runtime (i.e. do NOT mock \`loadSSH2\`), and prove that:
  (a) the ssh2 client actually connects to our fake server
  (b) the fake server receives a shell-channel write whose payload starts with \`exec sh -c '\` AND contains \`launching provider CLI\`
  (c) the CLI's stdout pipeline emits the dim-ANSI "launching provider CLI…" breadcrumb

This is the mechanical E2E proof that the ssh2 path actually fires the launch-checkpoint printf — the piece users have NOT been seeing in the released binary.

Use Vitest. Key shape:

\`\`\`ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { createServer } from 'node:net';
import { randomBytes } from 'node:crypto';
import { Server as SSH2Server } from 'ssh2';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import { runInteractiveSession } from '../../src/cli/lib/ssh-interactive.js';

// You will need an ephemeral RSA host key for the fake server.
// Generate once in the test with ssh2's utils or ship a fixture under
// tests/fixtures/ssh-host-key. Prefer generating at test time to avoid a
// checked-in private key:
//
//   import { generateKeyPairSync } from 'node:crypto';
//   const { privateKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
//     modulusLength: 2048,
//     privateKeyEncoding: { type: 'pkcs1', format: 'pem' },
//     publicKeyEncoding:  { type: 'spki',  format: 'pem' },
//   });
\`\`\`

Test plan:

**Test 1 — ssh2 path writes exec sh -c with launch checkpoint through a real ssh2 connection:**

1. Generate an ephemeral RSA host key.
2. Start an ssh2 Server listening on an OS-assigned port (pass 0 to .listen).
3. In the server's connection handler:
   - Accept \`password\` auth unconditionally for user \`test\` / password \`test\`
   - Accept the first session
   - When the client requests a PTY, accept it
   - When the client opens a shell, capture \`stream.on('data')\` — the first
     data chunk is what the CLI writes into the shell. Store it into
     \`capturedWrite: string\`, then write nothing back (or a trivial banner)
     and call \`stream.exit(0); stream.end();\` after a short delay so the
     CLI's close handler fires.
4. Spy on \`process.stdout.write\` (vi.spyOn) to capture every byte the CLI
   writes to stdout. Collect them into \`capturedStdout: string\`.
5. Spy on \`process.stdin.setRawMode\`, \`resume\`, \`pause\` and no-op them.
6. Call \`runInteractiveSession\` with:
   \`\`\`ts
   {
     ssh: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: serverPort, user: 'test', password: 'test' },
     remoteCommand: 'claude',
     successPatterns: [],
     errorPatterns: [],
     timeoutMs: 5000,
     io: { log: vi.fn(), error: vi.fn() },
     // No runtime override — use the real default loadSSH2.
   }
   \`\`\`
7. Await the result. Assertions:
   - \`capturedWrite\` starts with \`exec sh -c '\`
   - \`capturedWrite\` includes \`launching provider CLI\`
   - \`capturedWrite\` does NOT include \`; exit $?\` (regression for PR #743)
   - \`capturedStdout\` includes the literal text \`launching provider CLI\` — this proves the ssh2 data pipeline hands bytes back to stdout. (In the real sandbox, the printf is the FIRST thing the shell runs before exec claude. In this test, the server has to echo the payload back so the CLI sees "data" and writes it to stdout. See step 3.)
8. Always close the ssh2 server + client in an \`afterEach\` / \`finally\`.

**Test 2 — loadSSH2 returns a truthy ssh2 module in the default runtime:**

1. Import \`loadSSH2\` from \`src/cli/lib/auth-ssh.js\`.
2. Call it and assert the result is truthy AND has a \`Client\` constructor.
3. This is a canary: if the bundler ever starts externalizing ssh2 again,
   this test fails inside the Bun binary smoke check in Phase 6.

**Gotchas:**

- ssh2 Server needs \`hostKeys: [{ key: privateKeyPem }]\` in its options
- The server's \`ready\` event signals the client is ready — use it to know
  when to resolve \`new Promise\` wrappers
- Server must call \`accept()\` on authentication, session, pty, and shell
  requests (not \`reject()\`)
- The shell stream emitted by the server is a Writable you can write to,
  and a Readable you listen to (\`stream.on('data', …)\`)
- Remember to call \`stream.exit(0)\` before \`stream.end()\` so the client's
  \`exit\` handler fires before \`close\`
- Mock \`process.stdin.setRawMode\` so vitest doesn't crash in CI environments
  where stdin is not a TTY
- Give the test a \`timeout: 10_000\` suffix on the \`it()\` call

**Environment:**

If ssh2 types are not re-exported from '@types/ssh2' in the usual place,
use \`// @ts-expect-error\` or \`as any\` narrowly rather than fighting types.

The output ends with an \`EXIT: <code>\` line from the vitest invocation's
real exit code (captured via PIPESTATUS — do NOT trust tail's own exit).
If \`EXIT: 0\`, all tests passed — do nothing and end with LIVE_GREEN.

If \`EXIT: <non-zero>\`, diagnose and fix. The failure could be in:
  (a) the integration test itself (${LIVE_TEST}) — wrong ssh2 server API shape, missing accept() call, flaky timing, bad host key format
  (b) the test expecting different bytes than what the ssh2 path actually produces
  (c) a real bug in ${SSH_INTERACTIVE} that the mocked unit tests missed

If the failure is that the ssh2 client never connects: the ssh2 Server is probably not accepting auth correctly. Read the ssh2 \`Server\` docs, the \`auth-method\` on the auth context is 'password', and you must call \`ctx.accept()\` for it.

If the failure is that \`capturedWrite\` is empty: the client is connecting but the shell callback isn't firing — check that the server is accepting the 'session' + 'pty' + 'shell' subrequests.

If the failure is that \`capturedStdout\` does not contain the breadcrumb: the server needs to echo the captured shell-write back through the stream so the CLI reads it, prints it to stdout, and the spy captures it. Adjust the server shell handler to \`stream.write(capturedWrite)\` (or the portion after 'exec sh -c …') before \`stream.exit(0)\`.

Do NOT relax the assertions to make the test pass. The assertions encode the ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT from the workflow header — weakening them defeats the purpose.

Check:
  1. build-bun.sh: both \`--external ssh2\` occurrences removed, line continuations still valid, no other flags lost.
  2. The new integration test actually exercises the real ssh2 path (no loadSSH2 mock) and asserts the launch-checkpoint printf.
  3. No unrelated files modified.
  4. No secrets, credentials, or private keys committed.

Respond with one of:

  - REVIEW_BLOCK: <reason> — do not commit; explain what's wrong

Do not edit files in this step. Review only.`,

Next steps (MANUAL — not covered by this workflow):

  1. Commit and push on fix/cloud-connect-bundle-ssh2:

       git add scripts/build-bun.sh tests/integration/ssh-interactive-live.test.ts
       git commit -m "fix(cli): bundle ssh2 into Bun binary so cloud connect exercises the ssh2 path"
       git push -u origin fix/cloud-connect-bundle-ssh2

  2. Live Daytona validation against a real sandbox BEFORE releasing:

       # This requires CLOUD_API_* credentials and a real cloud workspace.
       # Expect to see the dim '[agent-relay] launching provider CLI…'
       # breadcrumb appear within 1-2 seconds of 'Starting interactive
       # authentication…'. If that line does not appear, the fix did not
       # land and the ssh2 branch is still being skipped.

       AGENT_RELAY_DEBUG_SSH=1 ./.release/agent-relay cloud connect claude

       Success criteria:
         - Unified 'Starting interactive authentication…' banner prints
         - Dim '[agent-relay] launching provider CLI…' breadcrumb prints
           within 1-2s
         - Claude TUI renders within 15s
         - First-byte debug log shows non-zero elapsedMs
         - AGENT_RELAY_DEBUG_SSH output shows 'shell-request' then
           'shell-opened' then 'shell-write'

  3. Open PR, get review, merge, cut new release.
